Type Opposite Images
====================

By Rhea Myers.

_Type Opposite Images_ (TOI) translates _Tokens Equals Text_'s vaporwave pastoral into a post-apocalyptic landscape of nuclear fallout and killer robots.

Tracking both the mood and the technological progression of the crypto artworld, it is a reversal and a composition. It might even be utility, although that doesn't accrue to the original.

The generated images show the tokens at the time of deployment. Use the app code for a live view.
